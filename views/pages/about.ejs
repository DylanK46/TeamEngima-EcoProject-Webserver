          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p class="text-body">
            is to connect, promote and empower the community to follow an environmentally positive future by increasing public awareness of environmental conditions around the community, and linking these to personal emotions and achievement.
          </p>

          <h2>We aim to</h2>
          <p class="text-body">
            Utilise big data and IoT to increase awareness of the environmentâ€™s effects on mental health and provides tailored pollution forecasts; empowering the community to take action.

            These are the driving questions behind Project ECO, the first project developed under Team Enigma, the AI group from Harrow School.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We hope to build a network of sensors around the Hill, monitoring pollution data daily. This real-time data, as well as all historical data, will be made public on our website. A custom-made AI will then crunch these data to make future predictions. As a bonus, boys are encouraged to submit their feelings about the day, in order to make a connection between environmental conditions and psychological effects.
